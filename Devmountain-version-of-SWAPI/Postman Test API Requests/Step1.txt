Step One
1.Open the GET.
2.Open the “Tests” tab.
3.Add a snippet for Status code: Code is 200
4.Run the request, check the test results, 1/1 should pass.

Great! You have a working test. If you want to verify the test, change the expected code in the test to a different response code:

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(300);
});
This should make the test fail – make sure you set it back to 200 once you’ve run it.
